#Layer Guides Photoshop Extension

Layer Guides is a Photoshop extension for creating guides around a layer with one click instead of dragging and placing a guide exactly on the edge of the layer.

The extension places guides around a layer (top, right, bottom, and left sides) and also on its vertical or horizontal centers.

## Installation
1. If you installed an older version of this extension manually (by moving files inside your Photoshop folder) you need to remove it before installing an update.

	- To uninstall the old version you can delete the folder **[Your Photoshop Folder]/Plug-ins/Panels/Layers Guide**.

2. Download the latest version of the extension and open it with [Adobe Extension Manager](http://www.adobe.com/exchange/em_download/).

3. Restart Photoshop and make sure you show the panel by going to Windows/Extensions and clicking on Layer Guides if this isn't checked.

## Usage
With a layer selected click on any of Layer Guides' buttons to create a guide.
