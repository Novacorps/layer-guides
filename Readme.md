#Layer Guides Photoshop Extension

Layer Guides is a Photoshop extension for creating guides around a layer with one click instead of dragging and placing a guide exactly on the edge of the layer.

The extension places guides around a layer (top, right, bottom, and left sides) and also on its vertical or horizontal center.

### Installation
Download the latest version of the extension and moveve the contents of the zip file into [Your Photoshop Folder]/Plug-ins/Panels.

Restart Photoshop and make sure you show the panel by going to Windows/Extensions and clicking on Layer Guides if this isn't checked.

### Usage
With a layer selected click on any of Layer Guides' buttons to create a guide.
